SimpleSinatraImageUploader
===

Sinatra server-side solution for file-uploader.

Aside from the uploader it self the javascript code is without any other
framework. But I think about changing it to XUI, jQuery or something
else.
Also I will evaluate if a redis backend for the filelist, metadata or
something else would be nice.
